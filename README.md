# REI201G-python-projects

A sample of projects for class REI201G.

The class revolved around working with data using Python.

Instructor: Kristján Jónasson

The project 'Lokaverkefni_HjorvarSigurdsson.ipynb' was a short final project involving an optimization problem -- more specifically finding the mininum of the Rosenbrock-function -- as well as working with data from a series of earthquakes around Fagradalsfjall in 2021, presenting it graphically, and mapping the various earthquakes unto a map of the area, differentiating them on the basis of their magnitude.
